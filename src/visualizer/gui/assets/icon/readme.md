Please treat the black on white SVG-file as base-file. All other files are copies of it only with the required edit.
The shape of the dots have their origin in the logo. So if required, treat the logo as base of this.

My workflow has been:
1) take the icon shape as svg from the original logo
2) apply the gradient that provides enougth contrast aswell on light as on dark-themes
3) export the png-files in multiple resolutions
4) run image magick (the command in the convert.bat) to combine all png-files to one multi-resolution ico file
