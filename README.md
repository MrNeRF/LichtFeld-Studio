## Support LichtFeld Studio Development

LichtFeld Studio is a free, open-source implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting that pushes the boundaries of real-time rendering performance.

**Why Your Support Matters**:
This project requires significant time and resources to develop and maintain. 

Unlike commercial alternatives that can cost thousands in licensing fees, LichtFeld Studio remains completely free and open. Your contribution helps ensure it stays that way while continuing to evolve with the latest research.

Whether you're using it for research, production, or learning, your support enables us to dedicate more time to making LichtFeld Studio faster, more powerful, and accessible to everyone in the 3D graphics community.

## Overview

LichtFeld Studio is a high-performance implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages modern C++23 and CUDA 12.8+ for optimal performance. Built with a modular architecture, it provides both training and real-time visualization capabilities for neural rendering research and applications.

### Key Features

- **2.4x faster rasterization** (winner of first bounty by Florian Hahlbohm)
- **MCMC optimization strategy** for improved convergence
- **Real-time interactive viewer** with OpenGL rendering
- **Modular architecture** with separate core, training, and rendering components
- **Multiple rendering modes** including RGB, depth, and combined views
- **Bilateral grid appearance modeling** for handling per-image variations
