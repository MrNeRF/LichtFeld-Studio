# "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" Reproduction in C++ and CUDA

## News
- **[2025-06-03]**: Switched to Gsplat backend and updated license.
- **[2025-05-27]**: Updated to LibTorch 2.7.0 for better compatibility and performance. Breaking changes in optimizer state management have been addressed.
- **[2025-05-26]**: The current goal of this repo is to move towards a permissive license. Some works has been done in this direction. However, as the major work package we must remove the rasterizer and replace it with the gsplat implementation.


## Build and Execution instructions
### Software Prerequisites
1. Linux (tested with Ubuntu 22.04), windows probably won't work.
2. CMake 3.24 or higher.
3. CUDA 11.8 or higher (might work with a lower version, has to be manually set and tested).
4. Python with development headers.
5. **LibTorch 2.7.0**: You can find the setup instructions in the libtorch section of this README.
6. Other dependencies will be handled by the CMake script.

### Hardware Prerequisites
1. NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support. Successfully tested so far are RTX 4090, RTX A5000, 3090Ti and A100. With 3080Ti there is an outstanding issue (#21) with larger datasets.
2. So far, the lowest compute capability tested was 8.0.

It might work with other NVIDIA GPUs as well, but these are mostly untested. If you do successfully run on such hardware please
post a message in the Discussions section of the repo.

### Build
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda
cd gaussian-splatting-cuda
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu118/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0%2Bcu118.zip  
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0+cu118.zip -d external/
rm libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0+cu118.zip
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -- -j
```

## LibTorch Version Update

**Important**: This project has been updated to **LibTorch 2.7.0** (previously used 2.0.1). Key improvements include:

- **Enhanced Performance**: Better optimization and memory management
- **API Stability**: Updated to use the latest stable PyTorch C++ API
- **CUDA Compatibility**: Better integration with CUDA 11.8
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved optimizer state management issues from earlier versions

### Migration Notes

If you're upgrading from a previous version:
1. **Download the new LibTorch version** using the updated build instructions above
2. **Clean your build directory**: `rm -rf build/` before rebuilding
3. **Compatibility**: The code has been updated to handle LibTorch 2.7.0 API changes automatically

### Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the original repository under the following link:
[tanks & trains](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip).
Then unzip it in the data folder.

### Command-Line Options

The `3D Gaussian Splatting CUDA Implementation` provides a suite of command-line options to facilitate easy and customizable execution. Below are the available options:

### Core Options

- **-h, --help**  
  Display this help menu.

- **-d, --data_path [PATH]**  
  Specify the path to the training data.
 
- **-f, --force**  
    Force overwriting of output folder. If not set, the program will exit if the output folder already exists.
 
- **-o, --output_path [PATH]**  
  Specify the path to save the trained model. If this option is not specified, the trained model will be saved to the "output" folder located in the root directory of the project.

- **-i, --iter [NUM]**  
  Specify the number of iterations to train the model. Although the paper sets the maximum number of iterations at 30k, you'll likely need far fewer. Starting with 6k or 7k iterations should yield preliminary results. Outputs are saved every 7k iterations and also at the end of the training. Therefore, even if you set it to 5k iterations, an output will be generated upon completion.

### Example

To run the `3D Gaussian Splatting CUDA Implementation` with specified data path, output path, and iterations, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./build/gaussian_splatting_cuda -d /path/to/data -o /path/to/output -i 1000
```

### Contribution Guidelines

Below are some guidelines to help ensure our project remains effective and consistent.

1. **Getting Started with Contributions**:
    - I've marked several beginner-friendly issues as **good first issues**. If you're new to the project, these are great places to start.
    - For those looking to contribute something not currently listed as an issue or propose something in the discussion section. You can direct message me on Twitter for a quick chat. Since there are not many contributors at the moment, I'm happy to discuss your ideas and help you get started.

2. **Before Submitting Your Pull Request**:
    - Ensure you've applied `clang-format` to maintain consistent coding style. There is in tools folder a git pre-commit hook. You can just copy it to .git/hooks/pre-commit. It will run clang-format before every commit.
    - We aim to minimize dependencies. If you're introducing a new one, it's essential to raise an issue for discussion first. There are ongoing efforts to reduce the number of dependencies, and your understanding in this area is appreciated.
